> Hashi is a specialized sushi restaurant finder. It relies on the phoneâ€™s geolocation to find nearby sushi restaurants. The true strength of Hashi is the way it deals with the complex nature of sushi restaurant menus. Hashi searches for suitable restaurants by ingredients and side dishes and returns results according to the number of those matches. For now, the application only covers the region of Kitchener-Waterloo.

Here's a [promo video](https://vimeo.com/133914663).

It's also on the [Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appchitects.hashi).

Hashi was our project for CS442/CS642 at University of Waterloo.
